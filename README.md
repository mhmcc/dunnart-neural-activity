## Overview
This repository contains:
* The Jupyter notebook `dunnart_analysis.ipynb` which runs the complete pipeline for analysing the calcium imaging data, generating results and rendering figures for our published study.
* Custom modules called from the notebook including:
  * `caimaging/tools` for extracting neural activity from 2D calcium imaging data using an ROI grid.
  * `fcnetwork/ggm`,`networkviz` and `stats` for estimating functional connectivity between ROIs using Gaussian graphical modelling and qunatifying properties of neuronal ensembles and network structure.
  * `wavetrack/wave_cc`, `wave_viz` and `direction_stats` for tracking and analysing properties of travelling wave activity.

## Installation and usage
To run the notebook (or use the custom functions on your own data):
1. Clone the repository.
1. Install the environment with `conda` using the included YAML file.
``` 
conda env create -f dunnart_analysis.yml
```
1. Download the data (see Data availability).
1. Set the `datapath`, `scratchpath` and `figpath` environment variables in the second code block of the notebook. The `datapath` must point to the `raw-2p` folder in the downloaded data. Create directories for `figpath` and `scratchpath` as necessary.
1. Run all cells in order.
